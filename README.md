# Geogram Predicates
A Rust port of `geogram`s _robust predicates_.
An interoperability ffi with `geogram`s _robust predicates_; via `cxx` also available.

<details>
  <summary><h4>Why Geogram</h4></summary>

Geogram is a scientifically proven, well-documented, feature-rich geometry processing library, which leverages _"[...] arithmetic filters (Meyer and Pion), expansion arithmetics (Shewchuk) and simulation of simplicity (Edelsbrunner)."_ <br>
Be sure to check it out [here](https://github.com/BrunoLevy/geogram).

It yields easy access to dependency-free parts of its code base, as so called _Pluggable Software Modules_ (PSM), which in turn make it easy to write `cxx_bridges` for these.

This library is licenced under the `LGPL-3.0 OR MIT`, when the legacy feature is enabled the c++ code it uses is under `Apache-2.0`.

## Example

With that, you can add geometry predicates to your rust project, without the need to re-implement existing state-of-the-art software.
E.g. using the rust alternative to geograms incircle predicate for triangles: 
```rust
use geogram_predicates::in_circle_2d_sos;

// Define three points that form a triangle
let a = [0.0, 0.0];
let b = [2.0, 0.0];
let c = [1.0, 1.0];

// Define two points, to test against the triangles circum-circle
let p_in = [1.0, -0.4];
let p_out = [1.0, -1.2];

let is_in_circle_p_in = gp::in_circle_2d_sos(&a, &b, &c, &p_in);
assert_eq!(1, is_in_circle_p_in);

let is_in_circle_p_out = gp::in_circle_2d_sos(&a, &b, &c, &p_out);
assert_eq!(-1, is_in_circle_p_out);

// Do something fancy based on the result
// ...
```

## Safety
The only unsafe code transmutes an array to a struct of the same size and types, which does not affect the values as long as it's not a reference.

## Visualizing Advantages of Robust Predicates

Below are visualizations comparing naive and robust `orient_2d` & `in_circle_2d` implementations. You can generate these images yourself by running the _examples_ for [`orient_2d`](examples/orient_2d/) or [`in_circle_2d`](examples/in_circle_2d/).

|               | Naive                                                   | Robust                                                     |

## List of currently supported predicates
### 2D
- [x] in_circle_2D_SOS()
- [x] orient_2d()
- [x] orient_2dlifted_SOS()
- [x] points_are_identical_2d()


### 3D
- [x] det_3d()
- [x] dot_3d()
- [x] in_sphere_3d_SOS()
- [x] orient_3d()
- [x] orient_3d_inexact()
- [x] orient_3dlifted_SOS()
- [x] points_are_colinear_3d()
- [x] points_are_identical_3d()

### Other
- [x] det_4d() (not in rust)
- [x] geo_sgn() (renamed to geo_sign)
- [x] initialize() (not in rust)
- [x] show_stats() (not in rust)
- [x] terminate() (not in rust)

There are a lot of predicates still to be implemented. If you are in need for a specific one have a look at the [geograms predicate list](https://brunolevy.github.io/geogram/predicates_8h.html). The bridge for any one predicate is implemented pretty quickly, so this crate is easily extendable.

## Design
The API to the `geogram predicates` is designed with the following design principles in mind:
- **Relation to geogram**: the _function names_, _signatures_ and _doc strings_ should be as close as possible to the original. This keeps maintaining, updating and comparing as simple as possible

## Development

Rust nightly is currently required for fuzz testing.

```shell
rustup default nightly
```

## Fuzz testing

```shell
cargo fuzz check
```

## Contribution
If you see something as
- software design principles that could be improved,
- potential bugs,
- ambiguous documentation, typos etc.,
- ...
